 <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
    pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
    account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the 
    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness</p>   
 <p> No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
    is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
    pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. </p>  
 <p>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain 
    pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances 
    occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure</p>  

 <p> To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious 
    physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? </p>
