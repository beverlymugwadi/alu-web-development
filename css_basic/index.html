 <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
    pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
    account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the 
    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness</p> 
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>

    occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure</p>
